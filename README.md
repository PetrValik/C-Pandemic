# Pandemic

It was a school project. I have to create a program which will simulate the progress of the pandemic spread of disease.
To complete this project I need to create parsers of CSV files in which the database was located. The task was inspired by the popular PC game Plague Inc: Evolved.
The task was based on an agent-like simulation where agents travel through location and get infected again and again until the disease is extinct or all agents die.


More information on the project and assignment are located in the file assignment.ad.
